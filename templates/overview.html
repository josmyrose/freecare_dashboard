        <h2>🏥 Project Overview: Impact of Free Primary Care on Healthcare Utilization Using Machine Learning</h2>

        <p>
            Access to affordable healthcare plays a vital role in improving health outcomes, especially for low-income families.
            This project investigates how providing <strong>free primary healthcare</strong> influences when and where mothers seek medical care for their children.
        </p>

        <p>
            Using data from a <strong>randomized controlled trial (RCT)</strong>—where households received different healthcare interventions (free primary care,
            health worker visits, or no intervention)—we explore the behavioral shifts in healthcare-seeking decisions.
        </p>

        <p>
            To quantify this impact, the project combines:
            <ul>
                <li>🔍 <strong>Machine Learning Models</strong>: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and XGBoost to classify healthcare utilization patterns.</li>
                <li>📊 <strong>Causal Inference Techniques</strong>: Including Difference-in-Differences and Propensity Score Matching to estimate the true effect of removing user fees.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            The findings offer <strong>data-driven insights for policymakers</strong>, helping them design effective interventions that enhance access to care, especially for vulnerable communities.
        </p>
